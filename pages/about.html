          About Pakistan:
        </h1>
        <p class="firstp">
          Pakistanis are citizens of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Islam-i
          Jamhuriya-e Pakistan). The nation of Pakistan came into existence in
          1947. Before that time, the region formed part of the British Indian
          Empire. Pakistan's history dates back nearly 5,000 years to one of the
          world's first urban (city-based) civilizations, which grew up along
          the Indus River. Pakistan was settled by peoples of varied ethnic and
          cultural backgrounds. In the Urdu language, the name Pakistan
          translates as "Land of the Pure." At the beginning of the eleventh
          century, rulers from Afghanistan mounted military campaigns over the
          mountain passes into the region that is India and Pakistan today. For
          over 650 years, a Muslim government based in Delhi ruled much of the
          area that makes up modern Pakistan. Toward the end of the sixteenth
          century, one emperor, Akbar, made Lahore the capital of his empire.
          Lahore is a major city in modern Pakistan. Britain took over the
          plains of the Punjab in 1849. Over the next hundred years, the British
          colonial government in India gained control over virtually all the
          lands and peoples that were to make up Pakistan. The modern state of
          Pakistan was created in 1947, when the British colonial possessions
          were divided between Pakistan and India. Pakistan's capital city is
          Islamabad. The traditional conflict with India has led to several
          military confrontations, with wars fought in 1947, 1965, and 1971.

        <h2>
          Location:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pakistan lies in the northwest part of the Indian subcontinent. It has
          an area of 307,304 square miles (796,095 square kilometers). Pakistan
          occupies the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, which officially belong
          to India. In size, Pakistan is slightly larger than the state of
          Texas. Its southern border is formed by a 650-mile (1,046-kilo-meter)
          stretch of coastline along the Arabian Sea. From there, the country
          extends northward for 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the mountains
          that lie along its northern border with China. To the west, Pakistan
          shares borders with Iran and Afghanistan. India lies to the east, and
          in the northeast is the disputed territory of Kashmir. Pakistan's
          western boundary was established by the British as part of their
          Indian Empire. The eastern boundary was set in the mid-twentieth
          century. When the British were preparing to give up control of their
          Indian Empire, Muslims living there were concerned that they would be
          a minority in a Hindu-controlled independent country. They demanded
          their own country. When the British left India, the Muslim majority
          areas in the north—one in the west and the other in the east—were
          separated to form Pakistan. Pakistan was then made up of two "wings"
          separated by 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of land belonging to
          India. East Pakistan, even though it had a Muslim majority, was
          culturally different from the West Pakistan. Eventually, civil war
          erupted. East Pakistan broke away (with Indian help) and became the
          independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. The boundary between India
          and West Pakistan divided the region of the Punjab in two. In 1947
          when the boundary was set, many people moved to live closer to people
          who were like them—Sikhs and Hindus moved into India, and a Muslims
          moved into Pakistan. This process was not peaceful, and an estimated 1
          million people died in the process. In the territory known as Jammu
          and Kashmir (usually called simply "Kashmir"), there have been
          tensions. In 1947, Kashmir had more Muslims in its population. But the
          ruler was Hindu, and he was reluctant to join either Pakistan or
          India. From 1947–49, there was armed conflict. A ceasefire was
          negotiated by the United Nations in 1949, but Kashmir remains divided,
          with Pakistani and Indian troops facing each other across the
          ceasefire line. The 140.5 million people of Pakistan encompass a range
          of distinct ethnic groups. Baluchis are found in the southwest, and
          Sindhis, in the south. The Punjabis of the northern plains of the
          Indus River make up the largest, and most politically influential,
          group in the country. In the northwest, Pashtun (also called Pakhtun
          or Pathan) are the main group. Tribal areas are administered by the
          federal government rather than by provincial governments. The ethnic
          mix of Pakistan is further modified by the muhajirs (Muslims from
          India who crossed into Pakistan in 1947, along with their
          descendants), who represent perhaps 10 percent of Pakistan's
          population. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979–88),
          there were an estimated 3 million Afghani refugees (mainly Pashtuns)
          in northwestern Pakistan. Pakistan is roughly divided into three
          geographic regions: the Indus plains, the northern mountains, and the
          hills and plateaus that extend from the Khyber Pass to Baluchistan.
          The Indus plains, and especially the northern region of the Punjab,
          form the heart of the country. In spite of the dry climate (Karachi
          receives about 8 inches, or 20 centimeters, of rain a year) and
          maximum temperatures that may hover above 104° F (40° C ) for months
          at a time, the plains support the largest part of Pakistan's
          population. Agriculture depends heavily on irrigation from the waters
          of the Indus River system. The northern mountain zone has some of the
          most rugged land found anywhere in the world. Nearly all the region
          lies above 7,800 feet (approximately 2,400 meters). The Karakoram
          Mountains contain some of the highest peaks in the world. More than
          fifty peaks are over 21,000 feet (6,500 meters) in elevation. The area
          is difficult to cross, especially in the winter months. It is sparsely
          populated with tribespeople who display a fierce sense of
          independence. Read more:
